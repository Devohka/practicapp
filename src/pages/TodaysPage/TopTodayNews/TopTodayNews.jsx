            <h2>Jupiter in the sky will resemble the Star of Bethlehem: how and when to see it</h2>
            <p>
                On Saturday, we will have a special astronomical event - Jupiter will shine in the night sky. It will be almost as bright as Venus, and it will be easy to see after sunset in the east.

                This will happen because Jupiter is located "in opposition" to the Sun, that is, opposite. This means that it rises when the Sun sets and "catches" all the sunlight, writes The Washington Post.

                Some even call it the Star of Bethlehem, reminiscent of the biblical story, according to which the "star from the east" led three wise men to the newborn Jesus.
